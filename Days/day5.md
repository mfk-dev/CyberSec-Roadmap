# Day 5

- My progress of the day:

## Report of the day:

---

### Date: February 3, 2026
### Status: In Progress

## 1. Cybersecurity and Digital Defense Line
-What I Learned: Cybersecurity is not just about writing code; 
it is the art of protecting networked systems, hardware, and most importantly, data from any unauthorized interference.

## 2. Identity Layers: Offline vs. Online
-What I Learned: Our identity is divided into two parts. 
-Our physical presence (Offline) and our digital footprints (Online).

## 3. The Framework of Information Security (CIA Triad)
-What I Learned: Information security is fundamentally based on these 5 rules:
---Confidentiality: Only authorized eyes should see it.
---Integrity: Data should not be corrupted/altered in transit or storage.
---Availability: The system should work “on demand” when needed.
---Continuity: Service should not be interrupted.
---Auditability: The answer to the question “Who did what and when?” (logs) cannot be deleted.

## 4. The Concept of “Hack” and Types of Hackers
-Hacking is operating a system or object outside its intended purpose. 
-Hackers are classified according to their intentions:
---Black Hat: Attackers focused on crime, seeking personal gain or causing harm.
---White Hat: Authorized, ethical defenders who close vulnerabilities (Bug Bounty Hunters, etc.).
---Grey Hat: Hackers operating in a gray area, generally acting on their own initiative but usually with harmless intentions.
---Warning: The law does not categorize hackers by type; if you are not a white hat, you are a criminal.

## 5. Attacker Profiles
-Script Kiddie: Amateurs with no deep technical knowledge who carry out simple attacks using tools (scripts) written by others. This is the most common risk group.
-Hacktivist: Groups that attack to convey a political or social message (e.g., Anonymous).
-Social Engineer: A type of “manipulative” hacker who exploits human psychology and weaknesses rather than technical vulnerabilities.

## 6. Professional Security Teams
-Red Team (Offensive): A team that approaches the system like an attacker, finding vulnerabilities through “realistic” attack simulations.
-Blue Team (Defensive): A team that detects and prevents attacks and defends the castle by continuously monitoring system security.

## 7. Distinction Between Threat and Attack
-A threat is a potential danger waiting at the door. 
-An attack is the realization of the threat.

## 8. Firewall
-A device that filters incoming and outgoing network traffic according to predefined rules.

## 9. Encryption
-Converts data from “Clear Text” (readable text) to “Cipher Text” (unreadable code).

## 10. Authentication and Authorization
-Authentication: Seeks the answer to the question “Who are you?” (Password, 2FA, Fingerprint).
-Authorization: Seeks an answer to the question “Where can you go?” Accessing the system does not grant the right to read every file.

## 11. Security Updates
-Fixes made to close vulnerabilities in the software.

## Steps 1-3 Summary:
Information security is about protecting information, etc., meaning it is a more general field. 
Cybersecurity, on the other hand, is a specific field that utilizes information security.

## Steps 4-6 Summary:
Hacking is doing anything to a system or object that is not its intended purpose.
Hackers are generally divided into 3 types (Black, White, Grey).
Attackers are generally divided into 3 types (Script Kiddie, Hacktivist, Social Engineer).
Professional Security teams are divided into 2 types: Red Team (Offensive) and Blue Team (Defensive).
There are multiple professions within both teams.

## 7-11 Steps Summary:
A threat is a potential risk, while an attack is the realization of that potential.
Firewalls are security systems that monitor network traffic and decide which packets can enter and which cannot.
An object or system is encrypted to hide/transmit it.
Adding a password, two-factor authentication, and similar actions are called “authentication,” and the authorization we receive after these actions is called “authorization.”
Security updates are fixes made to close vulnerabilities.
