###1. The DIKW Pyramid and Data Transformation
- What I Learned: I learned about the journey of data, starting from 0-1s, passing through the stages of information and knowledge, and reaching the level of “Wisdom.”

### 2. Data Structures and Variable Logic
- What I Learned: I learned about the concept of “Variables” used to process data in programming languages and that these variables occupy temporary space in RAM (Memory).

### 3. Digital Measurement Units and Data Types
- What I Learned: I learned about the capacity hierarchy from bits to petabytes and what data types used in software (Bool, Char, Integer, String, etc.) are used for and how much space (Bytes) they occupy in memory.

### 4. Database Logic and Memory Hierarchy
- What I learned: I learned that the place where data is permanently stored is called a Database; 
- RAM (Primary Memory) focuses on speed and cost, while Disk (Secondary Memory) focuses on capacity and permanence.

### 5. Big Data and File Management
- What I learned: I learned that the most basic form of data is stored on disks as “files,” and that enormous amounts of data that a single computer cannot handle are called Big Data.

### 6. Software Life Cycle and Waterfall Model
- What I Learned: I learned that the traditional method of developing software in a sequential order (Planning -> Design -> Analysis -> Coding -> Testing) is called the Waterfall Model.

### 7. Agile Methodology and Scrum
- What I Learned: I learned that today, models like Agile and Scrum, which are faster, more flexible, and open to continuous improvement, are used instead of Waterfall.

### 8. Algorithm: The Roadmap of Logic
- What I Learned: I learned that an algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions followed to accomplish a task; it exists not only in computers but also in everyday life (the legacy of Al-Khwarizmi).

### 9. Algorithm Analysis and Efficiency
- What I Learned: I learned that it is not enough for an algorithm to simply work; it must be designed to be the fastest and least taxing on the hardware (Optimization).

### 10. The Abstract and Concrete Relationship: Hardware and Software
- What I Learned: I learned that software is an abstract mind, while hardware is the concrete body that enables this mind to exist in the physical world.

### 11. The Holy Trinity of Computers: CPU, RAM, I/O
- What I learned: I learned that a computer needs three basic components to function:
- Processor (CPU): The brain that performs mathematical and logical tasks. (Processes commands such as 1+1).
- Memory (RAM): The area where data is temporarily stored for processing.
- Input/Output (I/O): Units that communicate with the outside world, such as the keyboard, mouse, and monitor.

### 12. The Computer Cycle
- What I Learned: I learned that a computer is a cycle that begins and ends with software; 
- that hardware components (CPU, RAM, I/O) work in harmony only thanks to binary codes consisting of 0s and 1s.

### 13. Operating System: The Bridge Between Hardware and Software
- What I Learned: I learned that the operating system (Windows, Linux, MacOS) is the most fundamental layer that controls the hardware and provides a working platform for applications. 
- Without an operating system, both hardware and software wont work.

### 14. Network and TCP/IP Protocol
- What I Learned: I learned that the Internet is actually the wired/wireless connection of computers to each other; 
- this communication operates within the framework of basic rules (protocols) called TCP/IP.

### 15. IP Addresses and DNS
- I learned that every device has a unique IP address for identification on the network; DNS is a guide that converts complex IP numbers into memorable names like “btkakademi.gov.tr”.

### 16. Packets and Routers
- What I learned: I learned that data travels in small packets on the internet and that these packets are delivered to their destinations via routers.



### 1-3 Summary of Steps:
- Data is the basic raw material of software. 
- Data is transferred to RAM via variables and processed there. 
- Each piece of data has a type and occupies a space in memory.
- The database is the fortress where this valuable data is permanently stored.

### 4-5 Summary of Steps:
- In the software world, if we want speed, we go to RAM (Primary), and if we want permanence, we go to Disk (Secondary). 
- Databases are structures installed on the disk that keep data organized/permanent.
- Some data is too large to be stored on a computer; this is called big data.
- Big data is stored in big data systems, for example: Twitter user data.

### 6-7 Summary of Steps:
- Old systems (those written with Waterfall) are generally cumbersome and difficult to patch. Modern systems (Agile) are updated much faster and are easier to patch.

### 8-9 Summary of Steps: 
- The essence of software is the algorithm. 
- The simpler and faster the sequence of commands prepared to solve a problem, the more robust the system becomes.

### 10-11 Summary of Steps:
- Hardware is the physical worker that carries out the software's commands. 
- While the CPU processes commands, RAM queues these commands, and I/O units establish the bridge between us and the machine. 
- Modern processors, with their multi-core architecture, process thousands of commands simultaneously in seconds.

### 12-13 Summary of Steps:
- If a computer is an orchestra, the operating system is its conductor. 
- It takes the raw power of the hardware (CPU, RAM) and transforms it into a platform that end users can click on and run applications. 
- Windows, Linux, and MacOS are different conductors managing this orchestra, but their purpose is the same: to translate the complexity at the binary level into a meaningful digital world.

### 14-16 Steps Summary:
- The internet is a massive network where billions of devices speak the same language (TCP/IP). 
- Every device has an identity (IP), and data is divided into packets to reach this address. 
- DNS helps us find this address, while routers provide directions.
