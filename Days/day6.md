## 1. Computer Hardware Components
- The key components include the central processing unit (CPU), which is the "brain" of the computer responsible for executing instructions and processing data. 
- The motherboard is the main circuit board that connects and allows communication between the CPU, memory, and other hardware.
- Random Access Memory (RAM) serves as the computer's short-term memory, storing data that is actively being used by the CPU for quick access.
- The storage device, such as a hard disk drive (HDD) or solid-state drive (SSD), is where data is permanently stored, including the operating system, applications, and files.
- Graphics processing units (GPU), dedicated for rendering images and videos, are important for tasks like gaming, video editing, and machine learning.
- Additionally, input devices like keyboards and mice, and output devices like monitors and printers, enable users to interact with the system.
- Together, these components make up the essential hardware of a computer.

## 2. Connection Types 
- There are several types of network connections that enable communication between devices, each serving different functions based on speed, reliability, and purpose.
- Ethernet is a wired connection type commonly used in local area networks (LANs), providing high-speed, stable, and secure data transfer.
- Wi-Fi, a wireless connection, enables devices to connect to a network without physical cables. It provides flexibility and mobility, making it popular in homes, offices, and public spaces.
- Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology primarily used for connecting peripherals like headphones, keyboards, and other devices.
- Fiber-optic connections use light signals through glass or plastic fibers to transmit data at very high speeds over long distances, making them ideal for internet backbones or connecting data centers.
- Fiber is faster and more reliable than traditional copper cables, but it is also more expensive to implement.
- Cellular connections, such as 4G and 5G, allow mobile devices to connect to the internet via wireless cellular networks.

## 3. NFC
- Near Field Communication (NFC) is a short-range wireless technology that allows devices to communicate and exchange data over very short distances.
- NFC is commonly used for applications such as contactless payments, electronic ticketing, and data transfer between devices.

## 4. Wi-Fi
- WiFi is a wireless networking technology that allows devices to connect to the internet and communicate with each other without physical cables.
- It uses radio waves to transmit data, typically operating on the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands.
- WiFi networks are created by wireless routers or access points and can be found in homes, offices, public spaces, and many other locations.

## 5. Bluetooth
- Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology standard used for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances. While it offers convenience for connecting peripherals and transferring information, it also presents several security concerns in the cybersecurity landscape.
- Bluetooth vulnerabilities can potentially allow attackers to intercept communications, execute malicious code, or gain unauthorized access to devices.
- Common attacks include bluejacking, bluesnarfing, and bluebugging.

## 6. Infrared
- Infrared (IR) is a type of wireless communication technology that utilizes light waves in the electromagnetic spectrum to transmit data between devices.
- Infrared connections are widely used in short-range communication, commonly found in devices like remote controls, wireless keyboards and mice, and computer-to-printer communication.

## 7. Basic Troubleshooting Process
- Identify the problem: Gather information on the issue and its symptoms, and attempt to reproduce the problem, if possible.
- Research and analyze: Search for potential causes and remedies on relevant forums, web resources, or vendor documentation.
- Develop a plan: Formulate a strategy to resolve the issue, considering the least disruptive approach first, where possible.
- Test and implement: Execute the proposed solution(s) and verify if the problem is resolved. If not, repeat the troubleshooting process with a new plan until the issue is fixed.
- Document the process and findings: Record the steps taken, solutions implemented, and results to foster learning and improve future troubleshooting efforts.

## 8. Basics of Computer Networking
- Computer networking is the practice of connecting computers and devices to share data and resources.
- It involves the use of protocols like TCP/IP for communication, hardware such as routers and switches for directing traffic, and various network topologies (e.g., star, mesh, bus) for organizing connections.
- Networks can be categorized by size and scope, from small local area networks (LANs) to wide area networks (WANs) that span large geographical areas.
- Key concepts include IP addressing, subnetting, DNS for name resolution, and network security measures.

## 9. GUI vs CLI
- A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with a software program, computer, or network device using images, icons, and visual indicators.
- The GUI is designed to make the user experience more intuitive, as it enables users to perform tasks using a mouse and a keyboard without having to delve into complex commands.
- Most modern operating systems (Windows, macOS, and Linux) offer GUIs as the primary means of interaction.
- GUI consumes more system resources (Memory, CPU etc.) than CLI.
- Also, Some advanced features might not be available or accessibly as quickly compared to CLI.

- A Command Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with computer programs or network devices directly through commands that are entered via a keyboard.
- CLIs are used in a variety of contexts, including operating systems (e.g., Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell, macOS Terminal, and Linux shell), network devices (such as routers and switches), and some software applications.
- CLIs are faster and more efficient in performing tasks once commands are known.
- Requires fewer system resources (memory, CPU) than GUI.
- But, it is steeper learning curve for beginners.
- Requires memorization or reference material for commands and syntax.

## 10. Understand Permissions
- Permissions in computing systems define the level of access and actions allowed for users or processes on files, directories, and resources.
- They typically include read (ability to view content), write (ability to modify), and execute (ability to run programs or scripts) privileges.
- Permissions are fundamental to system security, data protection, and user management, controlling who can access, modify, or run specific resources.
- In Unix-like systems, permissions are often represented as rwx (read, write, execute) for owner, group, and others. Windows systems use Access Control Lists (ACLs) for more granular control.

## 11. Common Commands
- Navigating the File System:
-    Unix/Linux: ls (list files), cd (change directory), pwd (print working directory)
-    Windows: dir (list files), cd (change directory), echo %cd% (print working directory)

- File and Directory Management:
-    Unix/Linux: cp (copy files), mv (move/rename files), rm (remove files), mkdir (create directory)
-    Windows: copy (copy files), move (move/rename files), del (delete files), mkdir (create directory)

- System Information and Processes:
-    Unix/Linux: top or htop (view running processes), ps (list processes), df (disk usage), uname (system info)
-    Windows: tasklist (list processes), taskkill (kill process), systeminfo (system details)
  
- File Permissions and Ownership:
-    Unix/Linux: chmod (change file permissions), chown (change file ownership)
-    Windows: icacls (modify access control lists), attrib (change file attributes)

- Network Commands:
-    Unix/Linux: ping (test network connection), ifconfig or ip (network interface configuration), netstat (network statistics)
-    Windows: ping (test network connection), ipconfig (network configuration), netstat (network statistics)
